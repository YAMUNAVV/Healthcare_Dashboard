* The Healthcare report is based on the concept to create a comprehensive data visualization solution using Power BI.

* The primary objective of this project was to develop an interactive and insightful data visualization tool to help a Hospital Management Team to track and analyze the patients visit, instruments availability and revenue generated by the patients of different age groups. Apart from this, management team can also see how long a patient has to wait for the appointment with the doctor and what is his or her feedback on doctor's prescription and other hospital services available.

* I took data source as MS excel and did all the data transformations like merge, remove, trim and change in column data type etc. in power query editor to ensure the consistency and accuracy and loaded the dimension and fact tables in Power BI.

* Also designed a data model to establish the relationships between the fact and dimension tables such as bed detail, staff detail , department and detail dataset table.

* Based on my data analysis I tried to figure out the requirements and developed the key performance indicators (KPI) using card visuals. I also developed a variety of interactive visuals using bar charts, line charts, maps and tables. I also used some custom visuals like rotating card, scroller etc.

* I also Implemented drill down and drill through capabilities to allow management team to see the detailed view of patients. The dashboard also includes filters and slicers to help the end users in slicing and dicing. The button navigators used, help the users to navigate through out the report.

* The project can help the management team with a centralized information to monitor the on going hospital activities and take data driven decisions.
